## Environment variables

The URI used to connect to MongoDB Atlas in defined in a .env file in the project root directory. The same applies for the port used by the app.

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=<URI>
PORT=<port>
```
The MongoDB URI can be obtained in the MongoDB Atlas database dashboard.
