My solution for exercises 2.18 to 2.20 of the Full Stack Open course.

**Setup**

Create a file named *.env* in the root of the project and add the following:

```
#.env

REACT_APP_API_KEY={your OpenWeather API Key}
```

You can get an API key by creating an account in [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org).
